            Here's some fun facts about Marc
        </p>

            <ol>
                <li>He is the youngest racer to win a premier class race, at 20 years old</li>
                <li> His nickname "The Ant" is because of his relative height, being shorter than most premier class racers</li>
                <li>He has a distinctly aggressive riding style, which many believe will be his downfall after so many injuries</li>
            </ol>
